# Background
> About 7 months ago, I was still working as ***an artist***. I had some **HTML/ CSS** background and was learning **JavaScript** for a few months by then after work.

# Why programming?

I was influenced by research about career happiness as well as other resources, such as 80000 hours, and waitbutwhy's comic on choosing a career. The tl;dr is that programming fulfills a lot of the criteria that I personally prioritize:

- Excellent job prospects
- Autonomy and engaging work
- Opportunity to do good
- Open to candidates without degree
- Lots of resources available online

# What helped?
- Learning how to learn by Barbara Oakley
- EdX's CS50 Course by Harvard
- Web Developer Roadmapâ€‹

# What I wish I knew

---

># It's going to be okay:

>It's okay not to know a lot of things. Not even the most experienced programmers know all the programming concepts.

>It's okay not to have a CS degree or even a degree. Employers are willing to hire developers without them if they are good. You can take the time to learn CS concepts afterwards.

>It's okay if you can't understand something. It's probably not because you are stupid. Programming is tricky, and sometimes you just need a break.

---

># Managing uncertainty:

>There's a mountain of things to learn and a myriad of paths. Don't worry about it too much if you've done your research and your current path is working for you. Pick one path and try to stick to it.

>You can't really predict how well you'll do in your programming career. Particularly if you don't fit with the stereotype. Don't knock it till you've tried it.

># How to learn effectively:

>Don't be afraid to fail. It's just code. But it's best to have people to give you feedback so you don't repeat mistakes.

>Learn in public. It makes you accountable for your learning journey and mistakes.

>Learn GIT and how to use the command line sooner. 

>Try to code or learn something every day. But remember to have time off. (Saturday is a break day for me.)
